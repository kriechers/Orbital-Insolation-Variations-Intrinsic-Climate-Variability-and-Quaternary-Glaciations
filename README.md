To date, this github repository contains the video supplement to
the manuscript 'Orbital Insolation Variations, Intrinsic Climate
Variability, and Quaternary Glaciations' written by Keno
Riechers, Takahito Mitsui, Niklas Boers and Michael Ghil. The
manuscript was submitted to Climate of the Past, today.

The repository is envisaged to be supplemented with computer code
that was used to generate several figures shown in the
manuscript.
