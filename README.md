*20211008*

To date, this github repository contains the video supplement to
the manuscript 'Orbital Insolation Variations, Intrinsic Climate
Variability, and Quaternary Glaciations' written by Keno
Riechers, Takahito Mitsui, Niklas Boers and Michael Ghil. The
manuscript was submitted to Climate of the Past, today.

The repository is envisaged to be supplemented with computer code
that was used to generate several figures shown in the
manuscript.

*Video supplement*

The video supplement to this article illustrates the pullback
attractor (PBA) associated with the simple system governed by
Eqs. (16) and (17). It shows a heat map of the phase plane,
derived from an increasing number of trajectories with common
initial time t i = −200 and final time t f = 200. The initial
radius and phase of each trajectory are randomly sampled from
Gaussian distributions centered at µ ρ = 20 and µ φ = 0 with
standard deviations of σ ρ = 5 and σ φ = 10, respectively. Over
the course of the video, 100 trajectories are continuously added
to the heat map and the annular disc D = {(ρ, φ) : ρ ∈ [µ − αβ, µ
+ αβ] and φ ∈ [0, 2π)} fills up. The heat map in Fig. 5(b) is a
snapshot from this video at time t = 0.2.
